# Erbil Polytechnic University - Bologna System Documentation

This documentation guide is designed for lecturers navigating the **EPU Bologna System** portal to manage student statistics, attendance, and academic grading.

## 1. Dashboard Overview

The central dashboard provides a high-level view of the university's academic status under the Bologna process.

### University Statistics

The system tracks real-time data across the university, including:

- **Total Students:** 24,295 students are currently enrolled in the Bologna system.
- **Successful Students:** 24,497 students have been recorded as successful within the system's tracking.

### Global Navigation Menu

The top navigation bar allows quick access to various modules:

- **Home (سەرەتا):** Returns to the main dashboard.

## 2. Managing Student Absences

Lecturers are responsible for maintaining accurate attendance records through the **Absents** module.

### How to Record Absences

1. **Navigate** to the "Absents" section from the top menu.
2. **Select the Session Details:** Input the **Date**, **Hour (کاتژمێر)**, and **Subject Type (جۆرى بابەت)** for the class.
3. **Mark Students:** Identify the students who were not present.
4. **Save:** Click the **Record (تۆمارکردن)** button to finalize the entry.

### Automatic Calculations

The system automatically tracks:

- **Total Absences (کۆى گشتى):** The total number of missed sessions.
- **Absence Percentage (ڕێژەى نەهاتن):** The current percentage of absences based on total course hours.

## 3. Academic Grading and Assessment

The **Student Grades** module is designed to handle continuous assessment according to ECTS standards, specifically managing the **60% Workload** total.

### Assessment Weights

The grading interface includes specific columns for different assessment types with pre-defined weights:

- **Quizzes:** Weighted at **8%**.
- **Reports and Projects:** Each component is weighted at **16%**.
- **Mid-term Exam:** Weighted at **24%**.
- **Homework:** Options for multiple assignments.

### Automated Grade Scaling

The system simplifies grade entry by allowing lecturers to edit the "Grade From" value for any assessment. You can enter the raw score from your specific test (e.g., a quiz out of 10 or a midterm out of 50), and the system will **automatically calculate** the corresponding ECTS-weighted grade for the final workload total.

## 4. Administrative Restrictions

To ensure the finality and integrity of academic data, the **Examination Committee** may restrict grade editing.

### Authority Suspension

When the grading period is closed, the committee suspends the lecturer's authority to modify marks. When this occurs, a warning banner will appear at the bottom of the grade sheet:

The system also provides a timestamp (e.g., `2026/02/11 - 01:38 AM`) for when this restriction was applied.
